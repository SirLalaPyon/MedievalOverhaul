Though these look like ordinary beets from the outside, on the inside they have distinct red-and-white-striped flesh. These are highest on the sweetness scale. While beets do require rich soil they are quite hearty, and will continue to grow very slowly through winter. They need to be planted during growing season, though.</description>
